# AVL-Tree-Animation

This project runs an application called VisuAVL which animates the properties of an AVL Tree.
This application is capable of displaying all the necessary steps of an algorithm using animation and it has 
some additional functionalities such as the capability of saving the tree.

One of the main difficulties that students face is visualizing how certain algorithms are executed as
applied to a certain problem. ‘VisuAVL’ is intended to solve is that, it helps users better grasp
and understand how its natural algorithms functions using animation. The user will be
able to see visually where the node will be inserted, and how the node is removed
from the tree. The algorithm’s execution steps at different points is illustrated via a
Java graphical user interface (GUI).
